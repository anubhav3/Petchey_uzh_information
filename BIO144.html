<p>Thanks for expressing interest in TAing on BIO144.</p>
          
<p><b>All TAing slots for FS19 are taken; there is no wait list.</b></p>          
          
<p> BIO 144 -- Data Analysis in Biology is a 4th semester mandatory course for  biology and biomedicine students. This is a great opportunity to impart to students the wonderful world of quantitative problem solving, in a large, interactive, and enjoyable class.  We will cover getting data, managing data, visualising data, summarising data, statistical analysis (mostly linear models, but also some other methods), and communicating results. In previous years the was a great success for the students, and we (the instructors) also had a great time (well, at least Owen did!).</p>
    
<p>The course lectures are 8-10am on Mondays, and practicals are 1-3pm Thursday (for half the students in the class) and 1-3pm Friday (for the other half) for 12 weeks (semester is 14 weeks, but two weeks involve holidays), from late February to early June. TAs are required during the practical classes. TAs can attend the lecture (by. Dr Stefanie Muff) on Monday morning to help prepare them for the following week's practical .</p>
          
      <p>During the practical class, all students are in the same large room, and they work through exercises. Instructors and TAs help students with questions, and can also pro-actively offer assistance.    </p>

<p>TAs should have some experience of helping students (and ideally have attended training on how to help students) and a good knowledge of data analysis, statistical methods, and R.</p> 
    
<p>Course material will be made available to TAs in time for them to familiarise themselves with it, and to seek assistance with any additional preparation they would like.</p>
          
<p>All grading is done automatically by computer, so instructors can focus their time on the fun stuff: interacting and helping the students.</p>
          
<p>All time used is counted, e.g. preparing for TAing, contact hours, forum moderation, all count. TAs must keep a track of their time spent on the course; Owen will verify this at the end of the course. For reference, one might expect 2 hours prep. and 2 hours TAing per afternoon, giving 48 hours for 12 afternoons TAing (half the course) or 96 hours for the whole course, plus time spent in administration and TA briefing/training sessions. Additional hours could be gained from invigilation of the final exam.</p>
          
<p>For continuity, any single TA should work on at least six afternoons, ideally consecutive, and ideally a TA would work on both Thursday and Friday of any single week.</p>
          
<p>Please sign up for afternoons on this doodle (https://doodle.com/poll/5vgumfvtqvzcx5hv). </a> You will be asked there for your email address and telephone (mobile please) number. You will be called only in urgent situations, for example if you don’t arrive at a class you signed up for. In return, TAs will get Owen’s number, in case he doesn’t turn up for class!!!
</p>

      <p>After you sign up on the doodle, you will be added to the Slack group that we use for all further communication.</p>          

      
<p>The doodle as eight TA slots on each afternoon. If there are no available slots on a date you would like to TA then send a message on Slack to ask if anyone wants to swap out with you. (Email Frank Pennekamp to be added to the Slack group if you are not a member.)</p>
      
<p>Please don't remove yourself from a slot if it results in the number of TAs dropping below 6.</p>
      
      
          
<p>Thanks very much, Owen.</p>
