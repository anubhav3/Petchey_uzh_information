<h1 id="BIO144 - basic TA info">Teaching Assistant information, BIO144, Data Analysis in Biology</h1>

<p>Thanks for expressing interest in TAing on BIO144.</p>          
          
<p> BIO 144 -- Data Analysis in Biology is a 4th semester mandatory course for the approx. 320 biology and biomedicine students. This is a great opportunity to impart to students the wonderful world of quantitative problem solving, in a large, interactive, and enjoyable class.  We will cover getting data, managing data, visualising data, summarising data, statistical analysis (mostly linear models, but also some other methods), and communicating results.</p>
          
<p>FS18 will be the second time we run the course. Last year, the first time we ran the course, was a great success for the students, and we (the instructors) also had a great time (well, at least Owen did!).</p>
    
<p>The course runs every Thursday (for half the students in the class) and Friday (for the other half), for 12 weeks (semester is 14 weeks, but two weeks involve holidays) in the spring semester 2018, from late February to early June. Each afternoon, from 1-3pm of practicals, led by Owen, during which TAs are required. The remainder of the afternoon, 3-5pm is lectures by Steffi, which TAs can attend to help prepare them for the following week's practical, will consist of about 2 hours of lecture (by. Dr Stefanie Muff).

<p>TAs should have some experience of helping students (and ideally have attended training on how to help students) and a good knowledge of data analysis, statistical methods, and R.</p> 
    
<p>Briefing sessions before the course will introduce TAs to the material.</p>
          
<p>All grading is done automatically by computer, so instructors can focus their time on the fun stuff: interacting and helping the students.</p>
          
<p>Time spent preparing and teaching will count towards PhD programme requirements. TAs should keep a track of their time spent on the course; Owen will verify this at the end of the course.</p>
          
<p>For continuity, any single TA should work on at least six afternoons, ideally consecutive, and ideally a TA would work on both Thursday and Friday of any single week.</p>
          
<p>Please sign up for afternoons on <a href="https://urpp-gcb.doodle.com/poll/ehdpm2yzq2zy2s7d"> this doodle. </a> You will be asked there for your email address and telephone (mobile please) number. You will be called only in urgent situations, for example if you don’t arrive at a class you signed up for. In return, TAs will get Owen’s number, in case he doesn’t turn up for class!!!
</p>
          
<p>After you sign up on the doodle, Owen will add you to the Slack group that we use for all further communication.</p>          
          
<p>Thanks very much, Owen.</p>
