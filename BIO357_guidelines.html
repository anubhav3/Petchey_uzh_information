<p> Thanks for your enquiry about doing an external research internship via BIO 357. </p>
          
<p>If you're interested in doing an internship with a group at UZH, please discuss with the possible supervisor, and if an intership looks likely, please contact Dennis Hansen to register you interest in the module, and check suitability. You can find his email address on <a href="http://www.ieu.uzh.ch/staff.php">this</a> page.</p>


<p> The regulations regarding an external research internship are <a href="media/extForschungsprakt.pdf">here</a>. There are a few things to do in order to get approval for an external research internship to contribute credit points. 1. Contact Dennis Hansen with your idea. You can find his email address on <a href="http://www.ieu.uzh.ch/staff.php">this</a> page. 2. Please have your external supervisor send an email to me with the following text: "I understand that I will be responsible of *insert name of student* during their Research Internship. I have read and understand the documents "<a href="media/357_FSHS_Petchey.doc">here</a>" and "<a href="media/BIO357%20Assessment%20Rubric.docx">here</a>". I am aware that the final report will be graded by a faculty member at the University of Zurich."
2. Please have the external supervisor also send their CV, with information included about previous experience supervising student projects.
3. Please also send a ~50 word summary of the proposed research project (this can come from you or the external supervisor).</p>

<p> I hope that you nor your supervisors feel this is too demanding. Once we receive this information, we will let you know about approval, or whether some discussion is needed.</p>

<b>Important:</b> the internship is assessed on the written report, according to the supplied rubric. Please make sure sufficient time and effort are dedicated to the written report! It is easy to fail (grade < 4.0) by submitting a poor report. </p>
