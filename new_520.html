<h2 id="a-new-option">A new option</h2>
          
<p> Dr Schaepman-Strub and Prof. Petchey are trialling a new option for this module. We would be happy for students to take this option, and to get feedback about it from students and supervisors. All other options remain available also, for the moment.</p>           

   <h2 id="general">General</h2>
       
          
<p>Responsible for this module is Dr Schaepman-Strub (you can find her email address on <a href="http://www.ieu.uzh.ch/staff.php">this</a> page. This module, designed as a self-study period of the Master degree course and comprising of a total of 300 study hours (corresponding to 2-3 months full time study), allows students to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of ecology and related fundamental biological concepts. In general, it is expected that the student uses the opportunity to acquire a broad and solid overview in Ecology, with some scope for additional focus on the general area of their Masters Thesis research. At the end of the self-study period is a three-hour written and a 30-60 minute oral examination.</p>
          
          <p>In the past, the module has often been scheduled after completion of the Master thesis. <em>However, students may find it more sensible and useful to perform the study before the Masters thesis research and are free to do so with agreement of their masters supervisor.</em> This arrangement must be entered in the Learning Agreement.</p>

          <h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>By the end of this module students should be able to</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Demonstrate their understanding and command of relevant diverse ecological facts, methods and concepts.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify and explain interrelationships between the various facts, methods and concepts.</p></li>
<li><p>Summarise and critically review scientific literature efficiently and effectively.</p></li>
</ul>
          
<h2 id="the-exams">The exams</h2>
<p>The three-hour written and the oral examination should ideally take place within one week of each other, with the written exam coming first. While an approximate date is already determined in the Learning Agreement at the start of the MSc Program, the precise dates must be arranged on an individual basis between the thesis supervisor, the student, and the person responsible for the module (see above). (All three must be present at the oral examination.)</p>
           <p>The final grade for the modue will be the arithmetic mean (rounded to half grades) of the grades obtained in the two parts. The oral and written part must each be graded at least 4.0 to pass. Retaking individual components (i.e., oral or written) is possible.</p>
          
          
          <h2 id="what-to-study">What to study.</h2>

<p>The 300 hours self-study should be used to read and learn 50 articles from  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0370-9">the list of 100 ecology papers in Box 1 on this web page.</a>. You and your supervisor can choose which 50.</p>
 
                    <h2 id="important">Important!</h2>

          <p>At least a week before the written exam, send the numbers of the 50 you chose to read and learn to the person responsible for the module.</p>
          
          
           <h2 id="the-written-exam">The written exam</h2>
        
          <p>The written examination lasts 3 hours. Unless otherwise agreed, the exam takes place at the Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies (IEU) in a room organized by the person responsible for the module (see above). Supervision of the exam is then handled by the person responsible for the module. The only materials allowed in the exam are pen and initially blank writing paper.</p>
          
          <p>You will be asked to do the following for each of five randomly selected articles from the 50 your read and learned: summarise the question addressed, hypothesis (if any), methods used, main results, and main conclusions (i.e. answer to question posed). You should also provide any relevant critical observation you make about the article. For additional credit, you should provide a synthesis of the five articles, e.g. what links them together / what can one learn from their combination that is not apparent from just the sum of their combined knowledge.</p>
          

           <h2 id="the-oral-exam">The oral exam</h2>
          
The examiners (i.e. the masters supervisor and the person responsible for this module) ask questions about the content of the written exam and any of the 50 papers read, and related subjects.          
          
<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>

<p><em>1. Who organizes the room for the written exam and the supervision of the candidate during the written exam?</em></p>
<p>In general, this will be the person responsible for this module (see above). They must be sent the numbers of the 50 papers chosen at least a week before the written exam.</p>

          <p><em>2. Who corrects and grades the written exam?</em></p><p>The person responsible for this module. The masters supervisor will get a copy of the exam paper and may provide comment to the module responsible person.</p>
